2.1. Introduction

In Sri Lanka, agriculture is an important industry that contributes significantly to both the country's economy and food security. Notwithstanding its significance, the industry faces serious obstacles such pest infestations, plant diseases, and wasteful resource use, all of which can lower crop yields and cause financial losses. Especially in large-scale farming operations, traditional techniques of controlling pests and keeping an eye on plant health are frequently labor-intensive, time-consuming, and ineffective.
With advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and drone technology, there is a promising opportunity to transform the agricultural sector through automation and optimization of crop monitoring and pest management processes. This project proposes the development of an AI-driven system that utilizes drones to conduct real-time plant health scanning and pest management. By integrating high-resolution imaging, machine learning models, and data analytics, the system aims to provide farmers with actionable insights to enhance crop health and productivity.
The proposed system will be tailored to Sri Lanka's diverse agricultural landscape, considering factors such as local climate, crop types, and prevalent pests. It will offer a cost-effective and scalable solution to improve precision agriculture practices, ensuring sustainable farming and more efficient resource management. Although drone technology is currently employed for various tasks in Sri Lanka, there is a notable gap in advanced plant health scanning and climate monitoring. Our project seeks to bridge this gap by developing an AI-enhanced system that delivers precise, actionable insights, thus enabling better crop management and boosting agricultural productivity across Sri Lanka.
Ex: in Sri Lanka main crop problem is flood, because of flood farmers are loses their crops and paddies in the eastern districts of Ampara, Batticaloa, Polonnaruwa, Trincomalee and north-central district of Anuradhapura. Sri Lanka will lose over one million tons from its upcoming paddy harvest due to recent flooding, officials say.
"We expected a yield of around 2.75 million metric tons from the harvest due in March to April," Kulugammanne Karunathileke, secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, told IRIN. "After the heavy rains we will only get around 1.75 million."
Karunathileke, the highest-ranking official at the ministry, said the country had expected a bumper crop - until flooding, which began in January, left some paddy fields under water for up to 11 days. Then I was decides to create a climate detecting system through based on AI and using drone based. Climate control systems play a vital role in ensuring food security, optimizing agricultural practices, and enhancing sustainability within the agricultural industry.    (TNH, 2011)  (view, 2024).
KURUNEGALA, Sri Lanka — With the COVID-19 pandemic contained following a strict two-month lockdown, Sri Lanka relaxed restrictions in late May 2020. But now, several farming communities are facing a second crisis in the form of hungry insects.
As the lockdown lifted, farmers and home gardeners from Mawatha Gama a hamlet in Sri Lanka’s north western province, wanted to resume cultivation, only to find a species of grasshopper destroying their crops.
Yellow-spotted grasshoppers (Aularches miliaris), commonly known as coffee locusts, first emerged in smaller quantities from a coconut plantation in the province, which is noted for its coconut production. Within a few days, the insect numbers increased. Soon after, grasshoppers started appearing in neighboring home gardens as well. Panicked residents called regional agricultural supervisors on May 30 to report the sightings and request aid.

2.2.1. Literature Survey 

•	Discusses AI-driven systems for crop health monitoring and pest control.

Abstract: The current scenario of agricultural trends requires resilience, constancy, and enhanced productivity to meet growing demands, confronting climate crisis, Tran’s boundary pests, and crop disease issues. Precision agricultural technologies encompass Artificial Intelligence (AI)–driven management systems, integrating field data collection and analysis reports on crop health, crop-related monitoring and management, harvest prediction, the optimization of fertilizers and pesticides, and the use and presence of pests or weeds. Conventional techniques for detecting crop vigor, robustness, and susceptibility to pest infestation or abiotic stress factors have some limitations. The monitoring of crops and agricultural land as well as the factors affecting crop health, achieved through AI-aided smart systems, has the potential to escalate crop productivity by using modern farming techniques. For the management of pests in precision agriculture, deep learning (DL)–based systems and convolutional neural network (CNN) models are used to detect pest-infested plants and also efficiently control them before they cause the plant to become diseased. Input data is collected from AI devices involving various associated parameters like light, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and fertilizer concentration. The collected data from satellite imagery, drones, and sensors is processed and managed by AI-driven precision agricultural systems. Thus, maximum output is achieved through optimal resource utilization, maintaining Agri-ecosystem sustainability. This chapter focuses on the major application areas of AI in precision agriculture for quick and eco-friendly solutions. (Dilipkumar, 2024)

•	Literature review focuses on existing problems in agriculture industry.

Abstract: Agriculture is the primary sector that supports Sri Lanka's economy. The introduction of novel technologies into agricultural practices will be of great assistance to farmers. The soil's pH and moisture content play a crucial part in the monitoring of soil fertility, irrigation level, and plant growth. Sometimes farmers were unsuccessful in selecting the appropriate crops to grow based on the conditions of the soil, the planting season, and the geographic location. Soil fertility is an important aspect in agriculture to determine the soil's quality. Soil nutrients are depleted after each harvest and must be replenished. The Irrigation system needs to control flood levels and adapt to paddy development. Water is necessary for the preparation of the ground, the planting of the crop, and crop upkeep throughout the growing-to-harvest cycle. The occurrence of paddy plant diseases and the presence of pests are two key factors that influence the production and quality of rice. One of the industry's biggest problems is the lack of a reliable method for determining paddy field soil nutrient levels, identifying the suitable crop, knowing the level of irrigation, and identifying the pest. This leads to farmers taking their own lives, leaving the agricultural industry, and moving to urban areas in search of work. This research has proposed a system to assist farmers in crop selection, fertilizer recommendation, irrigation, and pest detection by taking into account all of the relevant factors such as soil nutrient level, soil fertility, moisture level, PH, Temperature, and pest images. A mobile application and an intelligent method that is adapted to the requirements of the crop in each field can provide the farmer with information about the suitable crop, fertility of the soil, suitable fertilizer, irrigation level, and identified pest which will increase crop yield.

•	Focus on autonomous aircraft systems and greenhouse partner robot system.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is a major economic force in Sri Lanka, which contributes to the national economy, food security, and employment. The traditional methods practiced by farmers mainly drove the growth of the agriculture sector over the last 2500 years. However, these traditional methods have often been ineffective against pest attacks in recent years causing significant losses to farmers and threatening food security. To counter these issues, officials and researchers have started formulating novel technology-based smart solutions. This study proposes a smart, autonomous mobile robot that can help detect pests and diseases in advance and assist in crop estimation of chili plants. The model is created as such for pest and plant disease detection in small-scale chili plantations with the hope of using it in other crop types for the same purpose in the future. Thus, the proposed approach together with the developed model can be used to enhance the growth of other plants as well. Identification of the type of garden and the detection of pests and plant diseases are achieved using machine learning techniques while the identification of nutrient deficiencies is achieved using image processing techniques. This proposed mobile robot incorporates sensory inputs, machine learning, robotics, and image processing. Furthermore, a mobile application acts as the interface between the user and the robot.

•	Deep learning for disease detection, yield prediction, and remediation.
Abstract: Sri Lanka's rice cultivation is a vital industry supporting over 1.8 million cultivators and providing staple sustenance for 21.8 million people. According to Sri Lanka's Central Bank, rice cultivation contributed 2.7% to the country's GDP in 2020 [3]. Pests and diseases, particularly rice thrips damage and rice blast disease, are a challenge for the industry, as they cause yield loss. This paper describes an intelligent solution that aids stakeholders by detecting and classifying the disease, forecasting its dispersion, and providing remedies. The proposed solution is approached with deep learning techniques for real-time detection and classification of the disease, location tracking of infected areas, and pesticide application on the target. In addition, it predicts the spread of disease based on the locations of infected individuals. In addition, the solution enables Machine-learning algorithms to recommend appropriate rice varieties and predict yields. In controlled experiments utilizing data from Sri Lankan paddy fields, the proposed method obtained high accuracy rates of 89%-98% in identifying disease and rice varieties and yield prediction. This system has the potential to increase rice production and productivity, decrease yield loss, and benefit the Sri Lankan rice industry and producers. (Siventhirarajah, 2021)

•	Mobile app with budget planning, plant conditions, weather forecasting developed.

Abstract: Agriculture dramatically contributes to the economy by creating a monetary future for developing nations. However, in Sri Lanka, the farmers have confined resources and encounter numerous challenges to enrich their crop productivity and prevail in the competitive business world. In the directive, the farmers' knowledge about export crops and weak decision- making needs to be exposed [1]. This study has built a mobile application with budget planning, determining plant conditions, weather forecasting, analyzing harvest quality, and a price prediction system to mitigate these hardships. This application would be utilized to manage three critical plants in Sri Lanka t for extraction and export. Those are Vanilla, Pepper, and Cardamom. The key technologies used for the system are deep learning and machine learning. The overall system obtained desirable outcomes with an accuracy rate higher than 94%-97%. The ultimate intent of this study is to achieve the optimal growth of the agriculture sector by navigating the farmers to get maximum crop yield, quality, and effective decision-making through reliable market trends and to enhance the farmers' profit.

•	Empower farmers to identify and manage crop disorders
Abstract: We have developed a system facilitated by a mobile artefact to effectively identify crop disorder incidents and manage them using recommended control measures. This work overcomes the limitations of the existing attempts by using digital technology to empower farmers to identify crop disorders rather than replace them with automated techniques. Our approach empowers farmers by providing the information in context for them to identify crop disorders. The developed solution can identify most of the crop disorders instantaneously, irrespective of the crop or other factors that make crop disorder identification complicated. For the rest, it provides a mechanism to carry out a manual identification with the help of subject experts. The solution was deployed among paddy farmers in Sri Lanka to understand how well this could assist them in identifying and managing crop disorders. The system was able to identify 70.8% of the crop disorder incidents reported by the farmers and provided them with the relevant control measures. Farmers’ perceptions of various usability aspects of the solution revealed that the application of agrochemicals and expenses associated with agrochemicals were significantly reduced. It was also observed that the yield quality and quantity and overall revenue have increased compared to the previous seasons. (Janagan, n.d.)
•	Addresses problems faced by farmers in Sri Lanka.
Abstract: In Sri Lanka many problems have to be dealt with, to be a successful farmer Poor weather prediction, crop-raiding by wildlife animals and poor agricultural management are some of the main problems the farmers have been dealing with for a long time [1] We were looking forward to providing a solution for the farmers on the above-mentioned issues Currently, Farmers cultivate crops based on their past experience This is turning out to be difficult because of the changes in weather patterns due to industrialization and global warming We realized this could be overcome by an application that could process the data present in the agricultural and meteorological departments and give farmers insights about weather changes Crop-raiding is another problem that farmers need to face in Sri Lanka Farmers use traditional methods as fencing to prevent these attacks But still, the wildlife intrusions happen over a broken fence [2] The time taken to notify farmers regarding these problems ensures that the damage has already been done by the time they are informed As a solution, we are proposing to implement a system to identify the animals and notify the farmer as soon as possible Poor agricultural management implies a lack of knowledge about diseases, agrochemicals, and poor planning on cultivation [3] We are planning to improve this situation by gathering information regarding these and provide that information to farmers collectively through an application The final output of our research would be an application including a weather prediction, wildlife intrusion detection, and a sentimental analytical Chabot together.

2.4.	Full details of Artefact. 

Flight path optimization: 
This software artifact includes tools for planning and automating drone paths across agricultural fields, allowing for efficient and systematic coverage of areas needing monitoring. It enables flight planning to capture images of the crops from a bird’s-eye view and adjust drone paths based on specific field parameters. 
It assists in capturing satellite-like images of the field area, serving as a crucial starting point for data acquisition.
Plant health scanning 
This is a software artifact developed using frameworks like Tensor Flow, PyTorch, and Keras for building and training machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition. It scans images and sensor data to identify signs of crop stress, diseases, or pests. 
The model processes images captured by drones and extracts key indicators of crop health, which are essential for timely interventions.
LIDAR sensor integration:
Hyper spectral cameras and LIDAR sensors are examples of hardware artifacts that are necessary for collecting high-resolution data on field topography and crop health. In order to identify particular markers of plant health, including nutrient deficits or stress, hyper spectral cameras take pictures at various wavelengths. In the meantime, LIDAR sensors produce intricate three-dimensional representations of the terrain, offering details on elevation and field structure. They improve the precision and accuracy of the machine learning models used in plant health monitoring by enabling a deeper understanding of crop and soil conditions. This data-driven strategy encourages more focused, efficient crop management activities.
Ground Control
The Ground Control Station is a combination of software and hardware used to control and monitor drones in real time. It includes laptops or controllers that provide telemetry data (e.g., position, altitude, and battery levels), and may also host post-processing software for data collected by the drones.
GCS allows for hands-on monitoring of drone activity, providing operators with the flexibility to adjust flights based on data received. 
2.5.	Tools and Techniques:

2.5.1.	Hardware component  

Discuss the types of drones being used for plant health scanning and pest management. 
Drones 	Usages
Multirotor drones 	This drones are easiest and cheapest for getting frame. And hence they are perfect for aerial photography and surveillance.
Fixed-wing drones	This drone type only needs the energy to move forward and not to hold itself in the air. This makes them energy-efficient.
Single-rotor drones	Single-rotor drone types are strong and durable. They look similar to actual helicopters in structure and design.
Fixed-wing hybrid VTOL	Hybrid VTOL drone types merge the benefits of fixed-wing and rotor-based designs. This drone type has rotors attached to the fixed wings, allowing it to hover and take off and land vertically.

In here I was used waterfall methods,
 
Figure 2/ water fall module
Each stage of a hardware-focused project utilizing the Waterfall methodology will mostly entail actions pertaining to the drone and its parts:

	Analysis of Requirements: Describe the drone's hardware requirements, paying particular attention to features required for agricultural surveillance. Camera quality, sensor payload capacity (such as LIDAR and hyper spectral cameras), and flight time for covering particular field areas are a few examples of requirements.
	System Design: Create the drone's hardware layout based on the specifications. For health scanning, this will entail choosing the right drone models (such as Multirotor and fixed-wing) and incorporating sensors that can record crop data at different wavelengths.
	Implementation: Put the drone together, incorporating sensors such as hyper spectral cameras and LIDAR. This stage entails setting up the drone's payload to collect data effectively and making sure all parts are safely
	Testing: Evaluate the drone's hardware performance in the field, including battery life, camera stability, and sensor accuracy. This guarantees that the hardware functions efficiently in actual agricultural settings and that it gathers high-quality data for further AI processing.
	Deployment: The hardware is put into use in a real field after testing. The hardware capabilities of the drone are evaluated for dependability in various agro-climatic situations, despite the fact that the AI system has not yet been integrated.
	Maintenance: Sensors, power systems, and flight components are all inspected as part of routine hardware maintenance for the drone. This guarantees long-term robustness and preparedness for upcoming AI integration.

This method prepares the drone for future AI-driven image processing capabilities by ensuring that it is sturdy, dependable, and appropriate for gathering data in agriculture.




2.6.	Supporting information (if required)


2.7.	Answering the academic question.

I.	What is the impact of the introduction of AI and drone-based systems to the farmers in Sri Lanka?
The use of robots and drones in Sri Lanka’s agricultural system can immediately identify existing problems in identifying insects, diseases and pests in crops, finding places with nutritional needs, and monitoring crop outcome and quality.
	Insect and disease detection: 
Projects are not enough for farmers to detect and control insects and diseases. The use of agro-chemicals has long-term effects on the environment. Accurately detect diseases and insect pests through drones and AI-driven robots, and quickly accurate responses can be achieved.
	Monitoring crop results and quality: 
Through drone technology, farmers can monitor crop outcome and quality, which will contribute to farmers taking corrective measures according to market requirements.
	Commercial Advantages: 
By covering drones and robots in Sri Lanka's agriculture, it will help farmers to provide more efficiency and eco-friendly activities, improve quality and results, and solve problems in the short term.
	Places with nutritional need: 
In the event of a reduction in nutritional requirement to crops, those locations can be identified immediately and the process of development can be provided. Sri Lankan growers will be able to respond to short-term problems.


II.	What are the major challenges in integrating AI and drone technology for health monitoring and pest management for Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector?
	Lack of technical expertise:
They don’t have trainers for handling this drone system and controlling AI system, as many farmers and workers may not have the necessary technological skills.
	Climate:
Monsoons and high humidity, which can affect drone functionality and data collection, drones may face difficulties operating in Sri Lanka’s tropical weather conditions.
	Data accuracy and efficiency: 
Sri Lanka's diverse agricultural environments, climate, and insect changes must be specifically intended for AI systems, which makes it difficult to make accurate decisions for step-sized data.
III.	How much do AI and drone technologies contribute to the closure and early control of insect infestations in major crops in Sri Lanka?
	AI and drone technology are extremely valuable for managing and controlling pest outbreaks in Sri Lanka's major crops. 
	Drones can cover vast agricultural areas, capturing data on plant health in real-time, while AI analyzes this data to detect early signs of pest infestations. By identifying issues early, farmers can take timely action, reducing damage and increasing crop yield. Furthermore, AI can predict potential outbreaks, allowing for proactive pest management. 
	These technologies make pest control more efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly, supporting sustainable agriculture in Sri Lanka.             
IV.	How do local climate conditions in regions like Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and                                              Hatton impact the effectiveness of AI-driven pest management systems? 
The local climate in places like Hatton, Polonnaruwa, and Anuradhapura is a major factor in determining how effective AI-driven pest management systems are. Every area has a unique microclimate.
	Anuradhapura: Due to its hot, arid climate, which is prone to periodic droughts and erratic rainfall, the city is susceptible to pests like armyworms, which prefer dry environments.
	Polonnaruwa: Rapid pest infestations can result from a tropical monsoon climate, which includes substantial rainfall during specific months. AI systems need to identify these infestations early to avoid causing crop damage.
	Hatton: Fungal diseases and pests that love wetness thrive in the cooler, rainy climate of the central highlands, where tea and other cash crops are cultivated. For AI models to effectively forecast the development of pests, these fluctuations in temperature, humidity, and precipitation must be taken into consideration.
The accuracy of AI models, which rely on local climate data to optimize pest detection algorithms, can be impacted by insect behavior driven by the environment. Localized information is essential for efficient pest control because climate also influences the kinds of crops cultivated, pest lifecycles, and the timing of infestations.

V.	What role does climate data integration play in enhancing the accuracy of AI-based crop health assessments in Sri Lanka? 
	AI becomes more adept at anticipating pest outbreaks and identifying crop stress when climatic data is integrated. By taking into account variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity that are specific to Sri Lanka's many agricultural regions, it allows for more accurate monitoring.

VI.	How does the use of AI and drone-based pest management in Sri Lanka compare with similar systems in other countries with tropical climates? 
	Compared to Brazil, India, and Indonesia, which have more extensive implementations, Sri Lanka's AI-driven pest systems are still in the early stages of development. While other nations concentrate on large-scale, climate-adaptive AI models, Sri Lanka's smallholder farmers require more tailored solutions.

VII.	How can privacy and ethical concerns surrounding data collection using drones in agricultural fields be addressed? 
	Drones should gather anonymous data, get farmers' permission, and adhere to explicit guidelines on data use and storage in order to allay privacy concerns. This promotes moral behavior and increases farmer confidence.

VIII.	How can AI-driven drone systems be integrated into the existing agricultural practices of Sri Lankan farmers without disrupting their workflows? 
	Provide farmers with training, collaborate with cooperatives, and deploy the technology gradually in order to incorporate AI drones without interfering with workflows. The adoption of the new systems will go more smoothly with a phased approach.

IX.	How can drones be optimized for long-term operation in Sri Lanka’s diverse agricultural landscapes, considering battery life and terrain challenges?
	In order to handle a variety of settings, drones in Sri Lanka require longer battery lives, solar choices, and terrain-adaptive technologies. Designs that withstand weather are essential for efficient, long-term deployment in a variety of agricultural locations.

2.10.	Conclusion 

This research highlights the importance of leveraging AI and Drone technology to address key challenges in Sri Lanka’s agricultural sector, it related to pest management, plant health monitoring, and climate control. In pest management using drone already practiced in Sri Lanka, The use of AI to real-time climate monitoring and plant health screening is a major development that has the potential to completely transform precision agriculture. 
The suggested AI-driven system might significantly improve crop yield, minimize losses from climate-related calamities, and maximize resource utilization. Through the use of real-time data analytics, machine learning models, and high-resolution photography, the system can give farmers accurate and useful information so they may take prompt and efficient action to save their crops. This system will be flexible enough to adjust to the varied agricultural terrain of Sri Lanka, accounting for the regional climate, pests, and crop variations.
AI to automate processes such as soil analysis, pest detection, and climate control will not only make agriculture more efficient but also sustainable. Farmers in flood- prone and peat- effected regions, such as those in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, and kurunegale, will benefit from predictive capabilities that can help mitigate the impact of these challenges on crop yields. 
Even though there are drone-based systems currently in place, there is a chance to improve Sri Lanka's agricultural practices by incorporating advanced AI for plant health and climate monitoring. This AI-driven approach will continue to innovate and improve food security, agricultural productivity, and the country's agricultural sector's sustainability.
2.11.	Critical evaluation of the product.
In Sri Lanka's agriculture sector, the AI-driven system for pest management and plant health assessment has provided several important discoveries. Artificial intelligence-enabled drones can greatly improve the early identification of pests and plant diseases, enabling prompt responses. The system's versatility too many climates and crops is demonstrated by its capacity to evaluate data from multiple regions, including Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Hatton, increasing total agricultural productivity. Integrating climate data can also assist farmers in anticipating and reducing the effects of the environment on crop health.
Additionally, AI might be developed to provide policy recommendations based on past government data, and as 5G technology rolls out in Sri Lanka, communication between computers, mobile devices, and drones will get better. As the system becomes more widely used, its features may be expanded to include integration with e-governance services, which would simplify farmers' administrative and agricultural tasks.
Data security is a major worry, particularly when it comes to government access to private agriculture data. In order to prevent illegal global access, which could result in data misuse and potential cyber-attacks, the system should be limited to Sri Lanka with controls tailored to the needs of the nation. I didn't know much about artificial intelligence (AI) in agriculture at first, but this study helped me better grasp how it affects crop health and pest control. I also witnessed how AI can make difficult tasks simpler.
